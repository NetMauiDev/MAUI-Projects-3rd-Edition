## Get to Know the Authors
**Michael Cummings**
is a Senior Development Engineer with Microsoft. He currently works on the Visual Studio tooling for building WPF, Xamarin.Forms, and .NET MAUI apps. He has experience as a developer and architect with concentrations in app development, design, deployment, and business process as it relates to technology. Michael has been a graphics and game programmer since the days of the TI99-4/A. He started the Boston XNA Developers Group. He has contributed to many open-source projects, including AXIOM, a .NET/Mono 3D rendering engine, and Planeshift, a 3D MMORPG. Michael also has experience with native game and graphics development (C++/DirectX) on Windows. Michael lives in Lexington, MA with his wife and their dog. When not working with technology he enjoys watching movies, trying out new recipes, and the occasional game of full-contact racquetball.

**Daniel Hindrikes**
is a developer and architect with a passion for developing mobile apps powered by the cloud. Daniel fell in love with Xamarin in the early days of Xamarin when he realized that he could use C# even for iOS and Android apps and that he could share code with the Windows apps he was also building. But Daniel started to build mobile apps long before that, working on Android apps with Java and even Java ME apps (a long, long time ago). Daniel enjoys sharing his knowledge and can be found speaking at conferences, blogging, or recording the podcast, The Code Behind. Daniel works at the company tretton37 in Sweden and has experience working with both local and global customers.

**Johan Karlsson**
has been working with Xamarin since the days of MonoTouch and Mono for Android, and it all started with writing a game. He is a full-stack developer, currently focusing on mobile applications using Xamarin, but has in the past worked a lot with ASP.NET MVC, Visual Basic.NET (not proud), and C# in general. Also, he's created a whole bunch of databases in SQL Server over the years. Johan works at tretton37 in Sweden and has about 20 years of experience in the trade of assembling ones and zeros.
